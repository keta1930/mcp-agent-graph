          "content": "Welcome to Agent-Graph\n\nAgent-Graph is an intelligent agent system. You can interact directly with Agents like we're doing now - Agents use tools and memory to help you accomplish tasks. When you need to handle more complex workflows, you can combine multiple Agents into a Graph to achieve automation.\n\n---\n\n## Agent: Intelligent Entities that Think and Use Tools\n\nThe system's underlying Agent Loop is based on the ReAct architecture:\n\n**Think → Act → Observe Results → Think → Act**\n\nThis loop enables Agents to:\n- Understand your needs and formulate solutions\n- Call tools to retrieve information or execute operations\n- Adjust strategies based on results until tasks are completed\n\nAn Agent's capabilities come from the tools it can use. The system includes a rich set of built-in tools and supports connecting to external services, enabling Agents to handle various real-world scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Graph: Workflows for Multi-Agent Collaboration\n\nGraph is a workflow design approach. When a single Agent struggles with complex tasks, you can:\n\n- Break tasks into multiple steps, each handled by a specialized Agent\n- Enable Agents to exchange information and collaborate on tasks\n- Dynamically choose which Agent to execute next based on results\n- Save common workflows for reuse across different scenarios\n\nIt's like assembling a professional team where each member has their role, working together to complete projects.\n\n---\n\n## Tool Ecosystem: Expanding Agent Capabilities\n\nThe system provides two types of tools for Agents:\n\n**System Tools**: Built-in capabilities, including 9 major categories:\n\n| Tool Category | Capabilities Provided to Agents |\n|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| File Creator | Create and manage documents in conversations with automatic saving and version control |\n| Memory Tools | Long-term memory to remember your preferences and learn from experience |\n| Subagent | Delegate tasks to other specialized Agents for collaboration |\n| Agent Creator | Design and create new Agents - Agents can create Agents |\n| Graph Designer | Design workflows enabling Agents to build automation processes |\n| Prompt Generator | Create and manage prompt templates to capture quality prompts |\n| MCP Builder | Register external tools to connect more data sources and services |\n| Task Manager | Create scheduled tasks for automated execution |\n| System Operations | Query system resources to discover available models, tools, Agents, etc. |\n\n**MCP Tools**: External capability extensions\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) allows Agents to connect to the external world. You can configure MCP services for Agents to:\n\n- Access databases and APIs for real-time data\n- Call business systems to execute actual operations\n- Use internet services like search queries\n- Execute specialized tasks like code execution and data analysis\n\nMCP transforms Agents from conversational assistants into true business executors.\n\n---\n\n## Memory Architecture: Making Agents Smarter Over Time\n\nThe system uses a dual-memory architecture, allowing Agents to handle current conversations while accumulating long-term knowledge:\n\n| Memory Type | Stored Content | Purpose |\n|------------|----------------|----------|\n| **Short-term Memory** | | |\n| Conversation Context | Complete dialogue history | Support multi-turn interaction and context understanding |\n| Context Compression | Compressed key information | Maintain performance in long conversations |\n| **Long-term Memory** | | |\n| User Memory | Your preferences, habits, project background | Provide personalized service |\n| Agent Memory | Agent's learned experiences and patterns | Continuously optimize performance |\n\nMemories are organized by categories and Agents can intelligently retrieve relevant memories. This means Agents remember your previous preferences and learn how to better serve you.\n\n---\n\n## Open Ecosystem: Share, Export, Collaborate\n\nThe system provides complete data flow capabilities:\n\n**Share Conversations**: Generate public links for anyone to view conversation content without login\n\n**Export Data**: Export conversations to standard formats for LLM training or data analysis\n\n**Resource Migration**:\n- Batch import Agents (supports multiple formats)\n- Export and import Graph workflows\n- Export and import Prompt templates\n- Import memory data from other systems\n\nThis allows you to accumulate knowledge assets, share within teams, or migrate to other environments.\n\n---\n\nNext, I'll demonstrate these features through practical examples."

Next, I can review the document created by the Subagent, use the **same task id** to continue calling the Agent to execute tasks, or use a **new task id** to start a new task. This is perfect for work handoffs. This pattern is suitable for delegating complex tasks to specialized execution units while achieving context isolation."
