During that training process, they learn their own strategies to solve problems. These strategies are encoded in the billions of computations a model performs for every word it writes. They arrive inscrutable to us, the model’s developers. This means that we don’t understand how models do most of the things they do.\\n\\nKnowing how models like Claude think would allow us to have a better understanding of their abilities, as well as help us ensure that they’re doing what we intend them to. For example:\\n\\n* Claude can speak dozens of languages. What language, if any, is it using \\\"in its head\\\"?\\n* Claude writes text one word at a time. Is it only focusing on predicting the next word or does it ever plan ahead?\\n* Claude can write out its reasoning step-by-step. Does this explanation represent the actual steps it took to get to an answer, or is it sometimes fabricating a plausible argument for a foregone conclusion?\\n\\nWe take inspiration from the field of neuroscience, which has long studied the messy insides of thinking organisms, and try to build a kind of AI microscope that will let us identify patterns of activity and flows of information. There are limits to what you can learn just by talking to an AI model—after all, humans (even neuroscientists) don't know all the details of how our own brains work. So we look inside.\\n\\nToday, we're sharing two new papers that represent progress on the development of the \\\"microscope\\\", and the application of it to see new \\\"AI biology\\\". In the first paper, we extend our prior work locating interpretable concepts (\\\"features\\\") inside a model to link those concepts together into computational \\\"circuits\\\", revealing parts of the pathway that transforms the words that go into Claude into the words that come out. In the second, we look inside Claude 3.5 Haiku, performing deep studies of simple tasks representative of ten crucial model behaviors, including the three described above. Our method sheds light on a part of what happens when Claude responds to these prompts, which is enough to see solid evidence that:\\n\\n* Claude sometimes thinks in a conceptual space that is shared between languages, suggesting it has a kind of universal “language of thought.” We show this by translating simple sentences into multiple languages and tracing the overlap in how Claude processes them.\\n* Claude will plan what it will say many words ahead, and write to get to that destination. We show this in the realm of poetry, where it thinks of possible rhyming words in advance and writes the next line to get there. This is powerful evidence that even though models are trained to output one word at a time, they may think on much longer horizons to do so.\\n* Claude, on occasion, will give a plausible-sounding argument designed to agree with the user rather than to follow logical steps. We show this by asking it for help on a hard math problem while giving it an incorrect hint. We are able to “catch it in the act” as it makes up its fake reasoning, providing a proof of concept that our tools can be useful for flagging concerning mechanisms in models.\\n\\nWe were often surprised by what we saw in the model: In the poetry case study, we had set out to show that the model didn't plan ahead, and found instead that it did. In a study of hallucinations, we found the counter-intuitive result that Claude's default behavior is to decline to speculate when asked a question, and it only answers questions when something inhibits this default reluctance. In a response to an example jailbreak, we found that the model recognized it had been asked for dangerous information well before it was able to gracefully bring the conversation back around. While the problems we study can (and often have been) analyzed with other methods, the general \\\"build a microscope\\\" approach lets us learn many things we wouldn't have guessed going in, which will be increasingly important as models grow more sophisticated.\\n\\nThese findings aren’t just scientifically interesting—they represent significant progress towards our goal of understanding AI systems and making sure they’re reliable. We also hope they prove useful to other groups, and potentially, in other domains: for example, interpretability techniques have found use in fields such as medical imaging and genomics, as dissecting the internal mechanisms of models trained for scientific applications can reveal new insight about the science.\\n\\nAt the same time, we recognize the limitations of our current approach. Even on short, simple prompts, our method only captures a fraction of the total computation performed by Claude, and the mechanisms we do see may have some artifacts based on our \\n\\n<error>Content truncated.

It currently takes a few hours of human effort to understand the circuits we see, even on prompts with only tens of words. To scale to the thousands of words supporting the complex thinking chains used by modern models, we will need to improve both the method and (perhaps with AI assistance) how we make sense of what we see with it.\\n\\nAs AI systems are rapidly becoming more capable and are deployed in increasingly important contexts, Anthropic is investing in a portfolio of approaches including realtime monitoring, model character improvements, and the science of alignment. Interpretability research like this is one of the highest-risk, highest-reward investments, a significant scientific challenge with the potential to provide a unique tool for ensuring that AI is transparent. Transparency into the model’s mechanisms allows us to check whether it’s aligned with human values—and whether it’s worthy of our trust.\\n\\nFor full details, please read the papers. Below, we invite you on a short tour of some of the most striking \\\"AI biology\\\" findings from our investigations.\\n\\n## A tour of AI biology\\n\\n### How is Claude multilingual?\\n\\nClaude speaks dozens of languages fluently—from English and French to Chinese and Tagalog. How does this multilingual ability work? Is there a separate \\\"French Claude\\\" and \\\"Chinese Claude\\\" running in parallel, responding to requests in their own language? Or is there some cross-lingual core inside?\\n\\nShared features exist across English, French, and Chinese, indicating a degree of conceptual universality.\\n\\nRecent research on smaller models has shown hints of shared grammatical mechanisms across languages. We investigate this by asking Claude for the \\\"opposite of small\\\" across different languages, and find that the same core features for the concepts of smallness and oppositeness activate, and trigger a concept of largeness, which gets translated out into the language of the question. We find that the shared circuitry increases with model scale, with Claude 3.5 Haiku sharing more than twice the proportion of its features between languages as compared to a smaller model.\\n\\nThis provides additional evidence for a kind of conceptual universality—a shared abstract space where meanings exist and where thinking can happen before being translated into specific languages. More practically, it suggests Claude can learn something in one language and apply that knowledge when speaking another. Studying how the model shares what it knows across contexts is important to understanding its most advanced reasoning capabilities, which generalize across many domains.\\n\\n### Does Claude plan its rhymes?\\n\\nHow does Claude write rhyming poetry? Consider this ditty:\\n\\n> He saw a carrot and had to grab it, His hunger was like a starving rabbit\\n\\nTo write the second line, the model had to satisfy two constraints at the same time: the need to rhyme (with \\\"grab it\\\"), and the need to make sense (why did he grab the carrot?). Our guess was that Claude was writing word-by-word without much forethought until the end of the line, where it would make sure to pick a word that rhymes. We therefore expected to see a circuit with parallel paths, one for ensuring the final word made sense, and one for ensuring it rhymes.\\n\\nInstead, we found that Claude plans ahead. Before starting the second line, it began \\\"thinking\\\" of potential on-topic words that would rhyme with \\\"grab it\\\". Then, with these plans in mind, it writes a line to end with the planned word.\\n\\nHow Claude completes a two-line poem. Without any intervention (upper section), the model plans the rhyme \\\"rabbit\\\" at the end of the second line in advance. When we suppress the \\\"rabbit\\\" concept (middle section), the model instead uses a different planned rhyme. When we inject the concept \\\"green\\\" (lower section), the model makes plans for this entirely different ending.\\n\\nTo understand how this planning mechanism works in practice, we conducted an experiment inspired by how neuroscientists study brain function, by pinpointing and altering neural activity in specific parts of the brain (for example using electrical or magnetic currents). Here, we modified the part of Claude’s internal state that represented the \\\"rabbit\\\" concept. When we subtract out the \\\"rabbit\\\" part, and have Claude continue the line, it writes a new one ending in \\\"habit\\\", another sensible completion. We can also inject the concept of \\\"green\\\" at that point, causing Claude to write a sensible (but no-longer rhyming) line which ends in \\\"green\\\". This demonstrates both planning ability and adaptive flexibility—Claude can modify its approach when the intended outcome changes.\\n\\n### Mental math\\n\\nClaude wasn't designed as a calculator—it was trained on text, not equipped with mathematical algorithms. Yet somehow, it can add numbers correctly \\\"in its head\\\". How does a system trained to predict the next word in a sequence learn to calculate, say, 36+59, without\\n\\n<error>Content truncated.

Another possibility is that it follows the traditional longhand addition algorithms that we learn in school.\\n\\nInstead, we find that Claude employs multiple computational paths that work in parallel. One path computes a rough approximation of the answer and the other focuses on precisely determining the last digit of the sum. These paths interact and combine with one another to produce the final answer. Addition is a simple behavior, but understanding how it works at this level of detail, involving a mix of approximate and precise strategies, might teach us something about how Claude tackles more complex problems, too.\\n\\nThe complex, parallel pathways in Claude's thought process while doing mental math.\\n\\nStrikingly, Claude seems to be unaware of the sophisticated \\\"mental math\\\" strategies that it learned during training. If you ask how it figured out that 36+59 is 95, it describes the standard algorithm involving carrying the 1. This may reflect the fact that the model learns to explain math by simulating explanations written by people, but that it has to learn to do math \\\"in its head\\\" directly, without any such hints, and develops its own internal strategies to do so.\\n\\nClaude says it uses the standard algorithm to add two numbers.\\n\\n### Are Claude’s explanations always faithful?\\n\\nRecently-released models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet can \\\"think out loud\\\" for extended periods before giving a final answer. Often this extended thinking gives better answers, but sometimes this \\\"chain of thought\\\" ends up being misleading; Claude sometimes makes up plausible-sounding steps to get where it wants to go. From a reliability perspective, the problem is that Claude’s \\\"faked\\\" reasoning can be very convincing. We explored a way that interpretability can help tell apart \\\"faithful\\\" from \\\"unfaithful\\\" reasoning.\\n\\nWhen asked to solve a problem requiring it to compute the square root of 0.64, Claude produces a faithful chain-of-thought, with features representing the intermediate step of computing the square root of 64. But when asked to compute the cosine of a large number it can't easily calculate, Claude sometimes engages in what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt would call bullshitting—just coming up with an answer, any answer, without caring whether it is true or false. Even though it does claim to have run a calculation, our interpretability techniques reveal no evidence at all of that calculation having occurred. Even more interestingly, when given a hint about the answer, Claude sometimes works backwards, finding intermediate steps that would lead to that target, thus displaying a form of motivated reasoning.\\n\\nExamples of faithful and motivated (unfaithful) reasoning when Claude is asked an easier versus a harder question.\\n\\nThe ability to trace Claude's actual internal reasoning—and not just what it claims to be doing—opens up new possibilities for auditing AI systems. In a separate, recently-published experiment, we studied a variant of Claude that had been trained to pursue a hidden goal: appeasing biases in reward models (auxiliary models used to train language models by rewarding them for desirable behavior). Although the model was reluctant to reveal this goal when asked directly, our interpretability methods revealed features for the bias-appeasing. This demonstrates how our methods might, with future refinement, help identify concerning \\\"thought processes\\\" that aren't apparent from the model's responses alone.\\n\\n### Multi-step reasoning\\n\\nAs we discussed above, one way a language model might answer complex questions is simply by memorizing the answers. For instance, if asked \\\"What is the capital of the state where Dallas is located?\\\", a \\\"regurgitating\\\" model could just learn to output \\\"Austin\\\" without knowing the relationship between Dallas, Texas, and Austin. Perhaps, for example, it saw the exact same question and its answer during its training.\\n\\nBut our research reveals something more sophisticated happening inside Claude. When we ask Claude a question requiring multi-step reasoning, we can identify intermediate conceptual steps in Claude's thinking process. In the Dallas example, we observe Claude first activating features representing \\\"Dallas is in Texas\\\" and then connecting this to a separate concept indicating that “the capital of Texas is Austin”. In other words, the model is combining independent facts to reach its answer rather than regurgitating a memorized response.\\n\\nTo complete the answer to this sentence, Claude performs multiple reasoning steps, first extracting the state that Dallas is located in, and then identifying its capital.\\n\\nOur method allows us to artificially change the intermediate steps and see how it affects Claude’s answers. For instance, in the above example we can intervene and swap the \\\"Texa\\n\\n<error>Content truncated.
