# Core Components

Explore the fundamental building blocks of the MAG platform.

## Overview

MAG is built on several core components that work together to provide a comprehensive multi-agent platform:

- **Agent**: Autonomous units that execute tasks
- **Graph (Workflow)**: Orchestration layer for multi-agent coordination
- **Model**: LLM integration and management
- **Memory**: Persistent storage for agent and user data
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **Built-in Tools**: Rich toolset for agent operations
- **Prompt Center**: Centralized prompt management
- **Conversation**: Share and export conversations
- **Multi-User & Team**: Collaboration features

## Component Overview

### Agents
Agents are the core execution units in MAG. They can use tools, maintain memory, and collaborate with other agents to accomplish complex tasks.
