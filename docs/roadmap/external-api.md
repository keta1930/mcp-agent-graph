# External Agent API

Provide excellent Agents and workflows as external API services, building an Agent invocation ecosystem.

## Current Sharing Methods

Currently, developed Agents and workflows can only be shared in limited ways:

| Sharing Method | Description | Limitations |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Result Sharing | Share conversation outputs | Others cannot directly use the Agent |
| Package Export | Export configuration files for community use | Requires manual import and configuration |

## Coming Soon

Agent developers can open their Agents and workflows for others to call, building an Agent service marketplace:

### Core Capabilities

- **Public Access**: Expose your Agents and workflows as public APIs for other users and developers to call
- **Authorization Management**: Control who can call your Agents, set access permissions and quotas
- **Usage Monitoring**: View who calls your API, call counts, and usage statistics
- **Revenue Management**: Set fees for Agent calls and integrate with payment protocols

### Use Cases

| Scenario | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Agent as a Service** | Provide your developed Agents as services to other developers |
| **Monetization** | Excellent Agents can generate revenue through paid API calls |
| **Ecosystem Growth** | Developers share Agent capabilities, users call on demand |

## Agent Payment Ecosystem

The project will actively explore Agent commercialization and payment ecosystems:

### Protocol Exploration

Currently monitoring and researching the following Agent payment protocols:

- **AP2**: Agent payment protocol launched by Google
- **ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol)**: Agent commerce protocol launched by OpenAI
- **ANP**: Agent communication protocol promoted by the ANP community

By supporting these protocols, we may enable automated transactions and revenue distribution for Agent services in the future.

*External APIs will make excellent Agents accessible to more users and explore new possibilities in the Agent economy.*
