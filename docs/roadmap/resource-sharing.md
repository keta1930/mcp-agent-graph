# Team Resource Sharing

Resource sharing among team members is coming soon, breaking the current limitation of fully isolated resources.

## Current Status

Currently, team member resources are completely isolated:

| Resource Type | Current Status | Impact |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Agents | Private only | Cannot reuse Agents created by team members |
| Workflows | Private only | Cannot share workflow designs |
| Prompts | Private only | Prompts cannot be shared within the team |

## Coming Soon

Team resource sharing will enable sharing and collaboration among members:

### Core Capabilities

- **Resource Sharing**: Share Agents, workflows, prompts, and other resources with team members, with future support for Agent Skills
- **Permission Control**: Set visibility and usage permissions for resources
- **Collaborative Editing**: Support team members in refining shared resources together
- **Version Management**: Track modification history of shared resources

### Expected Benefits

Sharing features will bring:

| Scenario | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Avoid Duplication** | Configure once, use across the team |
| **Knowledge Retention** | Excellent Agents and prompts are preserved within the team |
| **Enhanced Collaboration** | Team members jointly improve workflows |
| **Quick Onboarding** | New members can directly use existing team resources |

*Resource sharing will make team collaboration more efficient and enable knowledge and experience to be preserved and passed on.*
