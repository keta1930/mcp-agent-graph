# User Analytics

Help users understand Agent usage through data analysis, optimizing resource allocation and usage strategies.

## Current Status

The platform currently lacks systematic usage data analysis:

| Aspect | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| Performance Evaluation | Difficult to assess the performance and value of different Agents |
| Team Insights | Cannot understand team members' usage habits and needs |

## Planned Directions

User analytics features may include the following directions:

### Performance Evaluation

- Agent response quality and user satisfaction
- Workflow execution efficiency and bottleneck analysis
- A/B testing to compare effects of different configurations

### Team Insights

- Team member usage habits and preference analysis
- Resource utilization and load distribution
- Collaboration patterns and knowledge flow

## Expected Value

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Quality Improvement** | Evaluate Agent performance to continuously optimize effectiveness |
| **Team Collaboration** | Understand team usage to promote resource sharing |
| **Data-Driven** | Use data to guide Agent optimization and resource allocation |
