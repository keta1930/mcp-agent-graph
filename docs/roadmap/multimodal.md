# Multimodal Support

The platform now supports multimodal capabilities, enabling Agents to process images and other content types. Vision Language Model (VLM) support is fully implemented and ready to use.

## Development Phases

| Phase | Modality | Core Capabilities | Status |
|-------|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Vision (VLM) | Image analysis, vision-language dialogue | ✅ Implemented |
| **Future** | More Modalities | Continuous expansion | Planned |

## Phase 1: Vision Language Models (VLM)

Vision language model support is now available, giving Agents the ability to "see" and understand images.

### Implemented Features

- **Image Input**: Upload images in conversations for Agents to analyze and answer questions
- **Vision-Language Analysis**: Understand text, objects, scenes, and other information in images
- **VLM Model Configuration**: Add vision-capable models in model management
- **Conversation History**: Save conversation records containing images

### How to Use

1. **Configure a VLM Model**: Go to the Model Management page and add a vision-capable model
2. **Upload Images**: In any conversation, click the image upload button or drag and drop images directly into the chat
3. **Ask Questions**: The Agent will analyze the image and respond to your questions about its content
4. **Multi-turn Dialogue**: Continue the conversation with follow-up questions about the image

## Future Plans

After vision capabilities stabilize, we will gradually expand to image generation, audio interaction, video processing, and other modalities, bringing richer perception and creation capabilities to Agents.

*Vision capabilities are now live! We will continue to monitor multimodal technology developments to bring additional modalities and richer interaction capabilities to the platform.*
