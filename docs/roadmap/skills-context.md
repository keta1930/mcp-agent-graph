# Agent Skills and Context Engineering

Introduce Anthropic's Agent Skills mechanism to enhance Agent capabilities and efficiency through progressive information disclosure.

## What are Agent Skills

Agent Skills are Anthropic's context engineering approach introduced in 2025, enabling Agents to load specialized instructions, scripts, and resources on demand.

### Core Concept

**Progressive Disclosure**

Like a well-organized manual that starts with a table of contents, then specific chapters, and finally detailed appendices—Skills let Claude load information only when needed, rather than loading everything at once.

### How It Works

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Folder Organization | Skills are folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources |
| On-Demand Loading | Load relevant Skills only when needed, reducing context overhead |
| Composability | Multiple Skills can be combined to meet complex requirements |
| Specialized Capabilities | Provide deep specialization for specific tasks |

## Planned Directions

The platform will explore integrating the Agent Skills mechanism:

### Potential Capabilities

- **Skills Library**: Pre-built professional skill packages (e.g., Excel processing, data analysis, document generation)
- **Custom Skills**: Users can create and manage their own skill packages
- **Skills Sharing**: Share and reuse Skills within teams
- **Smart Loading**: Automatically select and combine Skills based on tasks

### Expected Value

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Efficiency Gains** | On-demand loading reduces context length, lowering costs and latency |
| **Capability Extension** | Quickly add domain-specific capabilities to Agents |
| **Standardization** | Encapsulate best practices into reusable Skills |
